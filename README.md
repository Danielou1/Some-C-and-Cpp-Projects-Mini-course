    *   Breadboard, LEDs, Resistors, Buttons, LCD (HD44780 with I2C module), IR Receiver, TCS34725 Color Sensor, Servomotor (depending on the lesson).
*   **Software:**
    *   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    *   **VS Code Extensions:**
        *   [C/C++ Extension Pack (Microsoft)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack) - Essential for IntelliSense and debugging.
        *   [Code Runner (Jun Han)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) - For quick single-file compilation and execution.
    *   **AVR Toolchain:**
        *   [Microchip Studio](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio) (formerly Atmel Studio) - Provides the necessary GCC toolchain for AVR.
        *   Alternatively, a standalone AVR GCC toolchain (e.g., from [WinAVR](https://winavr.sourceforge.net/) or [MSYS2/Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com/)). *Ensure `g++.exe` and `gdb.exe` are in your system's PATH or configured in VS Code.*

## üöÄ Getting Started: Your Development Environment

1.  **Install VS Code & Extensions:** Follow the links above to install VS Code and the recommended extensions.
2.  **Install AVR Toolchain:** Install Microchip Studio or a standalone AVR GCC toolchain.
3.  **Configure VS Code:**
    *   Open this repository folder in VS Code.
    *   The `.vscode` folder contains basic configurations.
    *   **For Code Runner:** Ensure your `settings.json` (located in `.vscode/settings.json` or your global VS Code settings) has the following entries, adjusted to your `g++.exe` path (e.g., `C:\\cygwin64\\bin\\g++.exe`): 
        ```json
        "code-runner.executorMap": {
            "cpp": "cd $dir && \"C:\\\\cygwin64\\\\bin\\\\g++.exe\" $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt.exe && $fileNameWithoutExt.exe"
        },
        "code-runner.runInTerminal": true,
        "code-runner.saveFileBeforeRun": true,
        "code-runner.clearPreviousOutput": true,
        "code-runner.ignoreSelection": true,
        "code-runner.fileDirectoryAsCwd": true
        ```
    *   **Important:** If you encounter issues with `g++.exe` not found, verify its path in your system's environment variables or directly in VS Code settings.

## üìù How to Use

1.  **Navigate:** Open any `.cpp` file within a module folder in VS Code.
2.  **Compile & Run:**
    *   **Using Code Runner:** Click the "Run Code" button (triangle icon) in the top-right corner of the editor, or right-click in the editor and select "Run Code", or use the default shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N`.
    *   **Using VS Code Tasks (Advanced):** If `tasks.json` is configured, you can use `Ctrl+Shift+B` to build or `Ctrl+Shift+P` and type "Run Task".
3.  **Observe:** The output will appear in the VS Code integrated terminal. For microcontroller projects, observe the behavior on your connected hardware.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

*   **C to C++ Conversion:** All original `.c` files have been converted to `.cpp` for C++ compatibility. While efforts were made to maintain original functionality, some minor idiomatic C++ changes were applied.
*   **Hardware Specifics:** These examples are highly dependent on AVR microcontroller architecture and specific register definitions. Adaptations may be needed for different AVR families or pin configurations.
*   **Toolchain:** Ensure your AVR GCC toolchain is correctly installed and configured in your system's PATH or VS Code settings.
